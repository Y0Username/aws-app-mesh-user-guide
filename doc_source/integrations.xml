        <para>&MESH; is integrated with &CFNlong;, a service that helps you model and set up your
            &AWS; resources so that you can spend less time creating and managing your resources and
            infrastructure. You create a template that describes all the &AWS; resources that you
            want, for example an &MESH; mesh, and &CFN; takes care of provisioning and configuring
            those resources for you. </para>
        <para>When you use &CFN;, you can reuse your template to set up your &MESH; resources
            consistently and repeatedly. Just describe your resources once, and then provision the
            same resources over and over in multiple &AWS; accounts and Regions.</para>

                templates describe the resources that you want to provision in your &CFN; stacks. If
                you're unfamiliar with JSON or YAML, you can use &CFN; Designer to help you get
                started with &CFN; templates. For more information, see <ulink type="documentation"
