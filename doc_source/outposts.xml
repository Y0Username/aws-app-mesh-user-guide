    </info>
    <para>&outposts; enables native &AWS; services, infrastructure, and operating models in
        on-premises facilities. In &outposts; environments, you can use the same &AWS; APIs, tools,
        and infrastructure that you use in the &AWS; Cloud. &MESH; on &outposts; is ideal for
        low-latency workloads that need to be run in close proximity to on-premises data and
        applications. For more information about &outposts;, see the <ulink type="documentation"

        <para>An Outpost is an extension of an &AWS; Region, and you can extend an Amazon VPC in an
            account to span multiple Availability Zones and any associated Outpost locations. When
            you configure your Outpost, you associate a subnet with it to extend your Regional VPC
            environment to your on-premises facility. Instances on an Outpost appear as part of your
            Regional VPC, similar to an Availability Zone with associated subnets.</para>
