    </info>
    <para>The &AWS; global infrastructure is built around &AWS; Regions and Availability Zones.
        &AWS; Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which
        are connected with low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. With
        Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically
        fail over between Availability Zones without interruption. Availability Zones are more
        highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data
        center infrastructures.</para>

    <para>&MESH; runs its control plane instances across multiple Availability Zones to ensure high
        availability. &MESH; automatically detects and replaces unhealthy control plane instances,
        and it provides automated version upgrades and patching for them.</para>

    <!-- REMOVING THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE UNTIL LOCAL REGIONS ARE MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE-->
    <!--
    <para>If you need to replicate your data or applications over greater geographic distances, use
        &AWS; Local Regions. An &AWS; Local Region is a single data center designed to complement an
        existing &AWS; Region. Like all &AWS; Regions, &AWS; Local Regions are completely isolated
        from other &AWS; Regions.</para>
