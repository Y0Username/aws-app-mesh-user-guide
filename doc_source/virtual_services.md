# Virtual Services<a name="virtual_services"></a>

A virtual service is an abstraction of a real service that is provided by a virtual node directly or indirectly by means of a virtual router\. Dependent services call your virtual service by its `virtualServiceName`, and those requests are routed to the virtual node or virtual router that is specified as the provider for the virtual service\.

## Creating a Virtual Service<a name="create-virtual-service"></a>

This topic helps you to create a virtual service in your service mesh\.

**Creating a virtual service in the AWS Management Console\.**

1. Open the App Mesh console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/appmesh/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appmesh/)\.

1. Choose the mesh that you want to create the virtual service in\.

1. Choose **Virtual services** in the left navigation\.

1. Choose **Create virtual service**\.

1. For **Virtual service name**, choose a name for your virtual service\. You can choose any name, but the service discovery name of the real service that you're targeting, such as `my-service.default.svc.cluster.local`, is recommended to make it easier to correlate your virtual services to real services\. The name that you specify must resolve to a non\-loopback IP address because the app container must be able to successfully resolve the name before the request is sent to the Envoy proxy\. You can use any non\-loopback IP address because neither the app or proxy containers communicate with this IP address\. The proxy communicates with other virtual services through the names youâ€™ve configured for them in App Mesh, not through IP addresses that the names resolve to\.

1. For **Provider**, choose the provider type for your virtual service:
   + If you want the virtual service to spread traffic across multiple virtual nodes, select **Virtual router** and then choose the virtual router to use from the drop\-down menu\.
   + If you want the virtual service to reach a virtual node directly, without a virtual router, select **Virtual node** and then choose the virtual node to use from the drop\-down menu\.
   + If you don't want the virtual service to route traffic at this time \(for example, if your virtual nodes or virtual router doesn't exist yet\), choose **None**\. You can update the provider for this virtual service later\.

1. Choose **Create virtual service** to finish\.

**Creating a virtual service in the AWS CLI\.**
+ The following JSON represents a virtual service named `serviceB` that is provided by the virtual router named `serviceB`\.

  ```
  {
      "meshName": "simpleapp",
      "spec": {
          "provider": {
              "virtualRouter": {
                  "virtualRouterName": "serviceB"
              }
          }
      },
      "virtualServiceName": "serviceB"
  }
  ```

  If you save the preceding JSON as a file, you can create the virtual service with the following AWS CLI command\.

  ```
  aws appmesh create-virtual-service --cli-input-json file://serviceB-virtual-service.json
  ```
**Note**  
You must use at least version 1\.16\.235 of the AWS CLI with App Mesh\. To install the latest version of the AWS CLI, see [Installing the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*\.
