  <para>&MESHlong; works with &CTlong;, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user,
    a role, or an &AWS; service in &MESH;. &CT; captures all API calls for &MESH; as events. The
    calls captured include calls from the &MESH; console and code calls to the &MESH; API
    operations. If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of &CT; events to an &S3;
    bucket, including events for &MESH;. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most
    recent events in the &CT; console in <guilabel>Event history</guilabel>. Using the information
    collected by &CT;, you can determine the request that was made to &MESH;, the IP address from
    which the request was made, which user or account made the request, when it was made, and
    additional details. </para>

    <para>&CT; is enabled on your &AWS; account when you create the account. When activity occurs in
      &MESH;, that activity is recorded in a &CT; event along with other &AWS; service events in
        <guilabel>Event history</guilabel>. You can view, search, and download recent events in your
      &AWS; account. For more information, see <ulink url="&url-ct-user;view-cloudtrail-events.html"
        >Viewing Events with &CT; Event History</ulink>. </para>

    <para>For an ongoing record of events in your &AWS; account, including events for &MESH;, create
      a trail. A <emphasis>trail</emphasis> enables &CT; to deliver log files to an &S3; bucket. By
      default, when you create a trail in the console, the trail applies to all &AWS; Regions. The
      trail logs events from all Regions in the &AWS; partition and delivers the log files to the
      &S3; bucket that you specify. Additionally, you can configure other &AWS; services to further
      analyze and act upon the event data collected in &CT; logs. For more information, see the
      following: </para>

    <para>A trail is a configuration that enables delivery of events as log files to an &S3; bucket
      that you specify. &CT; log files contain one or more log entries. An event represents a single
      request from any source and includes information about the requested action, the date and time
      of the action, request parameters, and so on. &CT; log files aren't an ordered stack trace of
      the public API calls, so they don't appear in any specific order. </para>
