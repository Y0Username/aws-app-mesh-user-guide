      <para>&MESH; endpoints use the HTTPS protocol. All communication between the Envoy proxy and
        the &MESH; Envoy Management Service is encrypted.
        <!-- You can also encrypt traffic
        between virtual nodes in the same service mesh. For more information, see <link
          linkend="virtual-node-tls" endterm="virtual-node-tls.title"/> -->
        Communication between containers within virtual nodes is not encrypted, but this traffic
        doesnâ€™t leave the network namespace.</para>
